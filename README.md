Thesis Title: Dark side of Mobile Phone Technology: Assessing the Impact of Self-Phubbing and Partner-Phubbing on Life Satfaction.


- Abstract:
**Research Summary:**

**Objective:** This study explores the characteristics of self-phubbing and partner-phubbing and their effects on marital relationship satisfaction, communication quality, and overall life satisfaction.

**Methodology:** A quantitative approach was employed, involving 150 smartphone users in relationships in Malaysia. Participants completed a questionnaire, and data analysis was conducted using Partial Least Squares-based Structural Equation Modeling.

**Findings:** The study reveals that smartphone conflicts negatively impact relationship satisfaction but not communication quality. Additionally, communication quality indirectly affects life satisfaction through its impact on relationship satisfaction.

**Contribution:** This research fills a gap by investigating the consequences of self and partner phubbing on relationship and life satisfaction. It provides a validated research model based on primary data.

**Recommendations:** Practitioners can use these findings to improve relationship counseling, focusing on reducing tension arising from smartphone use. Future research should explore additional factors related to phubbing behavior.

**Impact on Society:** By highlighting the complex relationship between smartphone use, relationship happiness, and life contentment, this study promotes more mindful smartphone use and ultimately aims to contribute to healthier relationships and societal well-being.

**Future Research:** Future research will implement an artificial neural network approach to predict the most influential factors in phubbing behavior.

**Keywords:** Phubbing, cellphone conflicts, communication quality, relationship satisfaction, life satisfaction.


- Research Findings: The results of this survey show that smartphone conflicts harm relationship satisfaction but not communication quality. It was revealed that communication quality does not directly bring a negative impact on life satisfaction, but it directly affects relationship satisfaction, which, in turn, harms life satisfaction.



-Contributions:

This research addresses the gap and gives insight into the consequences of self and partner phubbing and its impact on the relationship and life satisfaction among partners by providing a research model that was validated with primary data.

Thesis Title: Development of a Neurofeedback Approach for ADHD Children

- Abstract:
 
**Research Summary:**

This research investigates the effectiveness of neurofeedback (NF) as a treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adults across various age groups. It aims to determine whether NF can effectively alleviate symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity associated with ADHD.

**Methodology:**

- **Participant Selection:** The study included children aged six to eighteen years old, representing different age groups.
- **Data Collection:** Electroencephalogram (EEG) data was collected from participants using 19 channels to assess ADHD symptoms and intellectual abilities.
- **Treatment Intervention:** Participants diagnosed with ADHD underwent NF treatment, which involved training to regulate brain activity.
- **Outcome Measurement:** The effects of NF on inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity were statistically analyzed to determine practical significance.

**Key Findings:**

- **EEG Results:** None of the participants showed signs of ADHD or above-average intellect based on EEG data.
- **Effectiveness of NF:** NF was found to be statistically and practically significant in reducing symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity in children diagnosed with ADHD.
- **Implications:** The research suggests the potential use of EEG-based databases and various approaches to develop prototypes for online classroom monitoring and performance assessments, indicating broader applications beyond NF treatment for ADHD.

**Conclusion:**

The findings indicate that NF holds promise as an effective treatment for ADHD symptoms in children. Additionally, the study highlights the potential for utilizing EEG-based data and innovative approaches for developing tools to support online classroom monitoring and performance assessments.
- Research Findings: The results of this survey show that smartphone conflicts harm relationship satisfaction but not communication quality. It was revealed that communication quality does not directly bring a negative impact on life satisfaction, but it directly affects relationship satisfaction, which, in turn, harms life satisfaction.



  
-Contributions:

The main contributions of this
research work are:
â€¢ We have created a dataset for image captioning in the Bengali Language.
â€¢ We have introduced a Bengali caption model that is achieved by focusing
attention on the characteristics recovered by utilizing two distinct CNN models.
â€¢ We have analyzed the performance of the proposed Bengali caption model and
compared the output with some existing models.
