Thesis Title: Dark side of Mobile Phone Technology: Assessing the Impact of Self-Phubbing and Partner-Phubbing on Life Satfaction.


- Abstract:
**Research Summary:**

**Objective:** This study explores the characteristics of self-phubbing and partner-phubbing and their effects on marital relationship satisfaction, communication quality, and overall life satisfaction.

**Methodology:** A quantitative approach was employed, involving 150 smartphone users in relationships in Malaysia. Participants completed a questionnaire, and data analysis was conducted using Partial Least Squares-based Structural Equation Modeling.

**Findings:** The study reveals that smartphone conflicts negatively impact relationship satisfaction but not communication quality. Additionally, communication quality indirectly affects life satisfaction through its impact on relationship satisfaction.

**Contribution:** This research fills a gap by investigating the consequences of self and partner phubbing on relationship and life satisfaction. It provides a validated research model based on primary data.

**Recommendations:** Practitioners can use these findings to improve relationship counseling, focusing on reducing tension arising from smartphone use. Future research should explore additional factors related to phubbing behavior.

**Impact on Society:** By highlighting the complex relationship between smartphone use, relationship happiness, and life contentment, this study promotes more mindful smartphone use and ultimately aims to contribute to healthier relationships and societal well-being.

**Future Research:** Future research will implement an artificial neural network approach to predict the most influential factors in phubbing behavior.

**Keywords:** Phubbing, cellphone conflicts, communication quality, relationship satisfaction, life satisfaction.


- Research Findings: The results of this survey show that smartphone conflicts harm relationship satisfaction but not communication quality. It was revealed that communication quality does not directly bring a negative impact on life satisfaction, but it directly affects relationship satisfaction, which, in turn, harms life satisfaction.



-Contributions:

This research addresses the gap and gives insight into the consequences of self and partner phubbing and its impact on the relationship and life satisfaction among partners by providing a research model that was validated with primary data.
